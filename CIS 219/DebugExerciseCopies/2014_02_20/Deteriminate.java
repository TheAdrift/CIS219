* In mathmatics there is a term called the "Detrminate"
* In the process of finding a determinate we need to find
* every possible order of numbers,without repeating terms.
* for example the numbers 123 could be written 6 ways
* 123,132,213,231,312,321
* Simularly we can find any combination of numbers of 4 through 8
* including the repeating terms
* By using a loop, we can find all of them
